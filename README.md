Project Description: 

Using this awesome application, users plan a date night by picking dinner and a movie. The Google Maps API displays nearby movie theaters and basic theater information. The Fandango API pulls movie information. When the user selects a theater and movie, the Google Maps API will search and return nearby restaurants. We will use the Parsley JS library to validate forms.

Breakdown of Tasks:

AJAX calls to Fandango API to return movie information and output to html
